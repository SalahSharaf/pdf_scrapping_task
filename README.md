# pdf_scrapping_task

this project i had in my working as a freelancer from Fiverr website
and it's a compined work of web scrapping and transilating and pdf scrapping for a custom tables only 
it was a hell of work 
i managed to scrape the webpage but for the pdfs it needed deeplearning and comuter vision which was out of my knowledge
i have used tabula to do the work forme 

## the final result is an csv file consists of the tables scrapped from the pdf 

## data :
#### i scrapped this (website https://www.moj.gov.kw/AR/Pages/Statistics078.aspx)
#### and it was above 530 pdf i have provided a sample in the repository for the transilated, raw data and the csv files extracted
